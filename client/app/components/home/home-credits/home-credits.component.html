              I am an Ancient Historian as well as a Digital Humanist. In addition to teaching at the university level, I have also worked professionally as a public school teacher and as an instructor for an intensive summer camp for gifted children. I have worked with students from middle school through college, and with varied skills, backgrounds, and challenges. As the son of two educators, teaching, whatever the subject, has been my lifelong calling.

              As a word, ‘history’ means critical inquiry, not merely the past. History is active, one does not simply learn history, one does history. I endeavor to connect students to the material, allowing them to encounter it on their own terms. Research and teaching are passions which fuel each other. Teaching history as a process of investigation and inquiry makes students into researchers. Doing so also means that we regularly cross disciplinary boundaries into unfamiliar territory in pursuit of questions. Effective teachers are lifelong learners who encourage students to join them in posing questions and pursuing answers. At the same time, students force their teachers to consider new angles and fresh questions. My own research is avowedly interdisciplinary, drawing on research from the fields of ancient history, archaeology, anthropology, epigraphy, linguistics, religious studies, economics, philosophy, political science, social psychology, network theory, and others. I teach students that scholars must use every tool, theoretical or methodological, in order to develop their questions and get at the problems posed by our sources. In so doing, every student finds that they will be able to use their strengths and also confront their weaknesses.

              My research focuses on the medieval Mediterranean during the age of the Crusades. My first book, <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501763465/dynasties-intertwined/" target="_blank">Dynasties Intertwined: The Zirids of Ifriqiya and the Normans of Sicily</a> (Cornell University Press, 2022) considers the relationship between the Norman kingdom of Sicily and the Zirid emirate of Ifriqiya (modern-day Tunisia) during the twelfth century. For this project, I used Latin and Arabic texts alongside digital resources like the Old World Drought Atlas to show the expansive networks that connected the Normans and Zirids to other polities across the Mediterranean, with a particular eye toward restoring the agency of the often-maligned Zirids.

              My current research projects include a co-authored partial translation of the geography of al-Idrisi, a book chapter on labor in the medieval Maghreb, and an article on the cultivation of coral in the coastal city of Marsa al-Kharaz in modern Algeria. I am also learning Python3 and hope to leverage this coding language into future projects related to quantitative text analysis of Arabic texts.
